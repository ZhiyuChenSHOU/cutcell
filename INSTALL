Installation instructions
=========================

This package uses CMake. It is advisable to build the program in a separate
directory. CMake calls this an "out of source build". After installing the
dependencies (libcgal-dev and libcgns-dev in debian), simply use:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install

Building a debian package
=========================

Install the debian dev tools and git-buildpackage. Use:

git-buildpackage

to build a new package. Use:

git-dch  --debian-tag='%(version)s' --new-version=${REL} --release
git commit debian/changelog -m "Release: ${REL}"
git tag -a ${REL} -m "Tagged for release: ${REL}"

to create a new versioned release. git-dch will use the git history to make the
Debian changelog and allow you to edit it.
