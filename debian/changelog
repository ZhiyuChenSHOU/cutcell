cutcell (0.0.2) maverick; urgency=low

  [ David Ingram ]
  * Created a simple CMakeLists.txt file to allow programes to be
    compiled
  * Created two new test for Intersection and Union, both these
    programmes start with the definition of a unit cube read from the
    file cube.nef3 as this is the fastest and most efficient way of
    initialising the data structures.
  * CMaleLists.txt has been updated to build both the new test files

  [ Bruce Duncan ]
  * Add make_cube_3 function from examples.
  * Convert Polyhedron to Nef_polyhedron and back, with
    Aff_transformation.
  * Use filtered, simple cartesian kernel with quotient float.
  * Make a grid of cubes and find the intersection.
  * Fix up UnitCube test case.
  * Move cube.nef3 into cutcell.cpp. Fix unsigned warning.
  * Output the grid as VRML2, other output to stderr.
  * Implement cell centroid.
  * Attempt to create testcase for Direction operator== bug.
  * Facet test case.
  * faceArea
  * Compute face properties.
  * Re-add a new make_cube_3 program.
  * Add visualisation program.
  * Add include ${CGAL_USE_FILE}
  * Add cutcell.cpp to CMakeLists.txt
  * Add .gitignore
  * Implement an Index_3 class for IJK of parent cell.
  * Add some assert statements.
  * Tidy up the code a bit.
  * Calculate the volume of cut cells.
  * Add comments and license.
  * Factor out the algorithm from the driver.
  * Hide data in container classes, provide access methods.
  * Move the test case back out of the algorithm. Oops!
  * Move N construction into array creation.
  * Split VRML output into separate function.
  * Create a stream modifier to allow different output formats.
  * Create a NEF output format.
  * Remove the global "UnitCube".
  * Fix bounds error on nested for loops.
  * Add more comments.
  * Create stub CGNS output.
  * Close and remove stub temporary file.
  * Google style guide cleanups.
  * More Google style guide cleanups.
  * Even more Google style guide cleanups.
  * Extend CGNS output with Base and Zone information.
