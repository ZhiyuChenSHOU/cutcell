\section{Introduction}

This software implements the Cut Cell method as described by \cite{dingram}. It
is intended to provide a computation mesh for the simulation of the flow around
solid bodies in Code\_Saturne \cite{code_saturne}.

\section{Method}

\section{Implementation}

The software uses the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL)
\cite{cgal}, which is a C++ library which uses templates to provide different
behaviour through various number ``kernels''. It provides ``Nef\_polyhedra'', a
polyhedron whose structure is specified through a local sphere map description.

The ``cutcell'' program is written in C++ to allow easy integration with CGAL
and the CFD General Notation System (CGNS) \cite{cgns}, which is well supported
by Code\_Saturne.

\section{Usage Instructions}

The software consists of two user interfaces to the library, one Graphical User
Interface (GUI) and one Command Line Interface (CLI).
